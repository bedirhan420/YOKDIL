The grave included many well-made knives and spearheads, which is a clear indication of the dead being a well-respected hunter. The scientists found bones from deer and llama, together with tools for butchering the animals. The real surprise came from the hunter’s own bones, which were thin and light, making scientists suspect that it could be a woman. This was confirmed by the examination of the protein amelogenin in the tooth enamel, which showed that the hunter’s dental enamel lacked Y chromosome-specific amelogenin. As a result, it was revealed that the hunter, estimated to have died at the age of 17-19, was indeed a woman. The discovery challenges the conception of hunter-gatherer communities in which men hunted while women took care of other chores such as collecting roots, fruits, and berries. The scientists broadened their studies with excavation reports from 107 Stone Age graves from 8000+ years ago across South and North America. The results showed that there were 26 graves with hunting weapons, and 10 of them probably belonged to women, which allowed archaeologists to reshape their views about Stone Age gender roles. --- QUESTION --- Which can be said about the findings from the excavation of a 9000-year-old grave in Peru?",

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Red wavelengths of sunlight are the biggest drivers of plant growth because they stimulate leaves to make the chlorophyll needed for photosynthesis. This is why some farms have started shining red LED lights on crops to boost their yields. But these are costly, energy-draining and do not distribute light as evenly to plants as sunlight. To address these issues, Alexander Falber from the University of New South Wales developed a material called LLEAF that passively converts some of the green wavelengths in sunlight - which are less important for plant growth - to red ones. It is a transparent plastic containing a fluorescent dye that absorbs green wavelengths of sunlight and re-emits them as red ones. LLEAF can be hung over existing greenhouses and creates a soft pink light inside. One important consideration is whether taking green light from plants and giving them extra red light might harm them, says farmer Henry Tissue. He noticed that lettuces grown under the material had an orange tinge, probably because the altered sunlight changed their composition of carotenoids and other pigments. \"But we need to do further research to see if this changes the flavour or nutrition,\" Falber says. By this technique, he believes it may even be possible to grow crops in parts of the world that do not normally suit them, if other variables like temperature and humidity are also controlled. --- QUESTION --- The underlined word 'converts' in the passage is closest in meaning to ----.",
