Furthermore, the methods used to clear the land—primarily slash-and-burn agriculture—release massive amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing significantly to global warming. These fires are also poorly controlled, frequently escaping into adjacent, untouched primary forest and causing widespread ecological collapse.

Driven by rising global demand for beef and leather, ranchers clear vast tracts of land, often illegally, to create grazing pastures. This unsustainable practice has decimated the habitat of numerous endemic species, including the jaguar and several species of threatened monkeys. Furthermore, the methods used to clear the land—primarily slash-and-burn agriculture—release massive amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing significantly to global warming. These fires are also poorly controlled, frequently escaping into adjacent, untouched primary forest and causing widespread ecological collapse.
