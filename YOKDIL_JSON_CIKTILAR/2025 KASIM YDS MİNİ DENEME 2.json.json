At a young age, Malthus showed remarkable aptitude for logic and debate, often challenging his father's liberal views on societal progress. This influential thinker was the first to propose a mathematical model to estimate what the future balance between human population and food supply might look like. He spent many of his days (and possibly nights) at the turn of the 19th century calculating how the population, growing geometrically, might eventually outpace the food supply, which he believed could only grow arithmetically. In the end, he calculated that mass starvation and poverty could become unavoidable—unless \"moral restraint\" was practiced. The fact that global society largely averted the widespread famines Malthus predicted—despite the world population multiplying several times over—has nothing to do with this great scholar's grasp of mathematics or logic. It has everything to do with the fact that he had to base his estimates on what he knew. Mechanical farming and chemical fertilizers were only speculative concepts, with none in widespread use.
