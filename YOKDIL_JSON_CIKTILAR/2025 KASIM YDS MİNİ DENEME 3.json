Biochemistry Expert: – ----- Researcher: – In that case, what other elements in the body's chemistry or metabolism might critically influence a drug’s performance? Biochemistry Expert: – The patient's genetic profile, liver enzyme activity, overall gut microbiome health, or the presence of concurrent medications. These all significantly contribute to how a drug performs.",

Professor: – Exactly. This narrow focus is generating a crisis in higher education student engagement and genuine intellectual curiosity are steadily declining in the freshman year.
