        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Fasting could boost your brainpower. A stomach hormone that stimulates appetite seems to promote the growth of new brain cells and protect them from the effects of ageing – and may explain why some people say that fasting makes them feel sharper. Ghrelin is known as the hunger hormone, as it is made by the stomach when it gets empty. If we go a few hours without food, its levels rise in our blood. But there is also evidence that ghrelin can enhance cognition. Animals fed reduced-calorie diets have better mental abilities. Injecting ghrelin into mice improves their performance in learning and memory tests, and seems to boost the number of connections in their brains. Now Jeffrey Davies at Swansea University, UK, and his team have found further evidence that ghrelin can stimulate brain cells to divide and multiply, a process called neurogenesis. When they added the hormone to mouse brain cells grown in a dish, it switched on a gene known to trigger neurogenesis. “If the same happens in animals, this could be how ghrelin affects memory,” says Davies, whose work was presented at the British Neuroscience Association conference in 2017. The work may have implications for treating neurodegenerative conditions.

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Fasting could boost your brainpower. A stomach hormone that stimulates appetite seems to promote the growth of new brain cells and protect them from the effects of ageing – and may explain why some people say that fasting makes them feel sharper. Ghrelin is known as the hunger hormone, as it is made by the stomach when it gets empty. If we go a few hours without food, its levels rise in our blood. But there is also evidence that ghrelin can enhance cognition. Animals fed reduced-calorie diets have better mental abilities. Injecting ghrelin into mice improves their performance in learning and memory tests, and seems to boost the number of connections in their brains. Now Jeffrey Davies at Swansea University, UK, and his team have found further evidence that ghrelin can stimulate brain cells to divide and multiply, a process called neurogenesis. When they added the hormone to mouse brain cells grown in a dish, it switched on a gene known to trigger neurogenesis. “If the same happens in animals, this could be how ghrelin affects memory,” says Davies, whose work was presented at the British Neuroscience Association conference in 2017. The work may have implications for treating neurodegenerative conditions. Davies's team have found that ghrelin, or chemicals that act the same way, could help treat some conditions like Parkinson’s disease.",

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Genetic testing of a 90,000-year-old sliver of bone from a 13-year-old girl has provided clear evidence of interbreeding between two distinct groups of early humans, something researchers had long suspected. Earlier analysis of the girl's mitochondrial DNA had shown that her mother was of Neanderthal ancestry. In addition to the studies carried out before, the new research, this time led by paleogeneticists at the Max Planck Institute, examined her entire genome. They then compared it to previously sequenced paleogenomes, including those of other ancient humans. The results were unambiguous - the girl's DNA matched Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes to an equal degree. She had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. \"When I first saw this combined ancestry, I got worried that I had made a mistake in the lab, and that this was somehow a mix-up of two different bones,\" says Max Planck's Viviane Slon. “It was only after repeating the experiments several times and consistently seeing the same result, that I convinced myself - and my colleagues- that the girl’s mixed ancestry was real.” The team’s finding of a direct offspring of a Neanderthal and a Denisovan implies that individuals from the two groups mixed when they had the opportunity to meet. \"Taken together with evidence that Neanderthals and Denisovans also mixed with ancient modern humans,\" says Slon, \"this suggests that different groups of humans have always mixed when encountering each other.",

Although the promise of new technologies is great for making life easier, this potential is highly dependent on the ability of older adults to learn to use such technologies. For this reason, it is important that effective training programmes be developed to teach older adults how to use new technology. The discipline known as human factors provides an effective means of accomplishing this goal. Human factor is a science focused on optimising interactions between humans and the machines they use, thereby resulting in improved safety and quality of life.
