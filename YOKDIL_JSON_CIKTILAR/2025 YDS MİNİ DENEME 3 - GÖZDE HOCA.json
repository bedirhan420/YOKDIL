        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- In an age when human activities are causing a rapid decline in biodiversity, it is fascinating to contemplate a time when exploration was, with similar rapidity, allowing the Western world greater comprehension of the Earth's beauties. The inexhaustible encyclopaedic appetite of the 18th-century Europe is revealed by the more than 12,000 illustrations of plants made throughout the Spanish Empire in the New World, the Philippines, and regions in the Americas and Asia touched by Spanish expeditions - during a period of approximately 25 years spanning the late 1770s and the early 1800s. In Visible Empire, Daniela Bleichmar curates a selection of these images, presenting them together with seven insightful essays on such entwined subjects as empire, race, botany, and natural history. Furthermore, the essays and images offer insights into not only the botanical works themselves, but also the visions and dreams of the people of the era. The works she includes represent the collection as unique in both the number and the excellence of the paintings it contains. Through her deep analysis, we are transported back through the centuries and brought into contact with the motivations of the Spanish explorers, scientists, and artists. Spanish authorities saw the discovery of these new kinds of plants as a possible source of wealth. They also viewed the knowledge of plants as a competitive weapon in their ongoing struggle with other nations - and in the attempt to recast conceptions of the regions where the paintings were produced. Contemporary viewers, by contrast, might see the images primarily as an impressive body of artistic work, with little political or historical meaning. --- QUESTION --- Which can be inferred from the passage?",

Gheldof took fat samples from these people's tummies and found that genes involved in both breaking down and making fat were unusually active in their fat cells. Gheldof also found these fat cells were 40 per cent smaller than those of people with a normal BMI and contained greater numbers of more active mitochondria. \"These findings suggest slim people are resistant to putting on weight because their fat cells burn a lot of energy through a futile lipid cycle,\" says Gheldof.

Fat cells may be smaller in these people because the futile lipid cycle builds up only a small amount of fat before breaking it down again. In contrast, people with obesity often have faulty mitochondria in their fat cells, meaning they cannot burn energy via the futile lipid cycle. \"Several groups are investigating ways to restore mitochondrial activity and start the futile lipid cycle to drive weight loss in people with obesity,\" says Siham Boudina at the University of Utah. \"The new findings show that they're on the right track,\" she maintains.
