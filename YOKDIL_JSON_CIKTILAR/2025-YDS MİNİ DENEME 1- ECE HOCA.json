        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Svante August Arrhenius was a Swedish chemist and one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read, despite his parents' wishes, and by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy. This amazing scientist was the first person to predict what the future atmosphere might look like in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. He spent many of his days (and likely nights) at the end of the 19th century calculating how the carbon released by burning coal (the major source of fuel at the time) might actually change the atmospheric carbon balance. In the end, he calculated that humanity could double the concentration of atmospheric carbon - in 3,000 years. The fact that Earth is now closing in on doubling that concentration just over 100 years after Arrhenius made his calculations has nothing to do with this great visionary's grasp of chemistry or math - it has everything to do with the fact that he had to base estimates on what he knew. The internal combustion engine was only a speculative invention, with none in use. No cars were on the road, and Arrhenius certainly had no idea about traffic jams, drive through windows, or airplanes. Who could have imagined today's level of fossil-fuel consumption 100 years ago? --- QUESTION --- What is the author's attitude towards Arrhenius?",

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Parkinson's disease, also called shaking palsy or paralysis agitans, is a slowly progressive disease of the nervous system in which an essential type of nerve cell located in a small part of the brain is destroyed. The cause of the disease is unknown, but there is speculation that a deficiency of vitamin E early in life may be responsible. Symptoms begin when there is an imbalance of two chemicals in the brain, dopamine and acetylcholine. These substances transfer messages between nerve cells that control muscle function. In Parkinsonism, the amount of dopamine is diminished, creating an imbalance that confuses nerve signals. Approximately 1 per cent of Americans over age 65 suffer from Parkinson's. Symptoms include muscular rigidity (first the legs, then the arms) and cramping, involuntary tremors, excessive salivation, impaired speech and a staring facial expression. Despite these symptoms, sensation and mental activity are not impaired. There is often a loss of appetite and some weight loss, giving rise to the possibility of malnutrition developing. There is no cure for the disease, although drugs are prescribed to assuage the symptoms. Along with medication, alternative therapies are also sometimes included in treatment. --- QUESTION --- It can be understood from the passage that Parkinson's disease -----------.",
