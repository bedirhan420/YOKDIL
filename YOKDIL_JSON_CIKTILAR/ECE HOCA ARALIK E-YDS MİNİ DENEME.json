        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Environmental diplomacy can be broken into two general categories: conventions regulating the use of natural resources and conventions regulating pollution. In each case, the central problem is that political boundaries rarely reflect biological boundaries - as national economies consume resources and produce pollution, they spread environmental problems far beyond their national boundaries and thus cannot control them. For example, the sheer size of the US economy has given it both the power to degrade the environment around the world and the strength to push diplomatic efforts to protect the environment.

It focused on a child's 'theory of mind', suggesting that children have theories for the way their minds work as well as the way other people's minds work. Studies examining children's theory of mind are examples of how recent cognitive development research has moved away from experiments designed to test Piaget's theory. Many studies no longer concern which Piagetian tasks can be done earlier and instead aim to provide theoretical explanations for why and when children might be successful on certain tasks.

For example, if psychologists using these techniques can map out when the various brain structures develop during childhood, it may become possible to predict when the skills and capabilities that rely on those structures will emerge. Another burgeoning area of research in cognitive development examines the influence of culture on cognition in order to test the universality or uniqueness of development across cultures. For example, the study of culture is critical for investigating how language and thought may affect each other, understanding why some people believe intelligence is primarily innate and others believe it is primarily the product of effort, and determining how people may solve problems differently based on their cultural norms. --- QUESTION --- The recent studies on children's cognitive development ----.",
