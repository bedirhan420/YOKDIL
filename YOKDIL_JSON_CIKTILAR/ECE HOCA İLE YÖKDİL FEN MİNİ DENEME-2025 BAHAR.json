        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Mammals have spread successfully over the entire world, and have even conquered extreme habitats such as deserts and the Arctic. In spite of all external diversities, they have numerous characteristics in common. Mammals are the most highly developed vertebrate animals. Their constant body temperature grants them a life largely independent of temperatures of the surrounding areas. They achieve constant body temperature by a high food intake ─ in comparison to reptiles, for example ─ and an increased rate of metabolism. Long respiration, typical of mammals, supplies the body cells efficiently with oxygen. The heart consists of two atria and two ventricles, which are completely separated from each other. This prevents the mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient blood. All mammals, except for the egg-laying monotremes, give birth to live young. During pregnancy, the foetus is linked to the circulatory system of the female and is supplied with nutrients via the placenta and umbilical cord. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide also takes place using this route. --- QUESTION --- Which of the following is true about mammals?",

            "A) As a result of their adaptation to living in different habitats around the world, their physical appearances have become varied.",

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Mammals have spread successfully over the entire world, and have even conquered extreme habitats such as deserts and the Arctic. In spite of all external diversities, they have numerous characteristics in common. Mammals are the most highly developed vertebrate animals. Their constant body temperature grants them a life largely independent of temperatures of the surrounding areas. They achieve constant body temperature by a high food intake ─ in comparison to reptiles, for example ─ and an increased rate of metabolism. Long respiration, typical of mammals, supplies the body cells efficiently with oxygen. The heart consists of two atria and two ventricles, which are completely separated from each other. This prevents the mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient blood. All mammals, except for the egg-laying monotremes, give birth to live young. During pregnancy, the foetus is linked to the circulatory system of the female and is supplied with nutrients via the placenta and umbilical cord. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide also takes place using this route. --- QUESTION --- Which of the following is true about the biology of mammals according to the passage?",

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- A humanoid robot, often referred to as an android in science fiction, is designed to resemble the human form. Basic humanoid automatons have existed for centuries, and have gradually been refined to more closely mimic our appearance and behaviour. One of the first well-documented examples is Leonardo da Vinci’s mechanical knight. Da Vinci’s robot was operated by a series of pulleys (a set of wheels) and cables that allowed it to stand, sit and independently move its arms. It had a human form and was even dressed in armour to resemble a knight. Although da Vinci’s design is primitive by today’s standards, lacking any artificial intelligence or remote control, it was ahead of its time in the 15th century. Da Vinci employed the use of pulleys, weights and gears in many of his inventions, including his self-propelled cart which many consider to be the first robot. He later went on to design the robot knight for a royal event in Milan that took place during the late 1490s. Da Vinci’s drawings for the robot knight are still used as models by modern robotics, and even helped develop robots for NASA. --- QUESTION --- According to the passage, which of the following is true about humanoid robots?",
