Biologists split up this teeming diversity of life into categories depending on each organism’s shape and appearance and its anatomy using a scheme referred to as biological taxonomy. Life on Earth is organised into a hierarchical structure by a modern classification system using eight taxonomic ranks. The top rank is known as a domain, each of which is divided into several kingdoms, which then split into a number of phyla. ---- Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist and zoologist, laid down the foundations of this system in the early 18th century.",

In spite of all external diversities, they have numerous characteristics in common. Mammals are the most highly developed vertebrate animals. Their constant body temperature grants them a life largely independent of temperatures of the surrounding areas. They achieve constant body temperature by a high food intake ─ in comparison to reptiles, for example ─ and an increased rate of metabolism. Long respiration, typical of mammals, supplies the body cells efficiently with oxygen. The heart consists of two atria and two ventricles, which are completely separated from each other. This prevents the mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient blood. All mammals, except for the egg-laying monotremes, give birth to live young.
