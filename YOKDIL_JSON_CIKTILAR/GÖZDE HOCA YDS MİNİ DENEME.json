        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- As refractive errors are very common in eyes, throughout history, practitioners of the eye health have tried various and sometimes hazardous methods for improving or restoring vision. The earliest documentation of corrective lenses for this purpose dates to the 16th-century China. European traders who travelled to China noted the elderly holding quartz crystal lenses to see objects close to them. Eyeglasses set in frames and worn on the face began to appear in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. By the late 19th century, inventors were experimenting with glass lenses placed directly on the eye. These attempts produced large, heavy, and ultimately unfeasible lenses that covered the entire surface of the eye. The contact lens finally became a reality in the 1950s with the advent of high-tech plastics that were lightweight, optically clear, and did not react with body fluids. Subsequent advances over the next 30 years brought about lenses made of surgical plastics that allow oxygen to reach the cornea, much improving comfort and safety.
