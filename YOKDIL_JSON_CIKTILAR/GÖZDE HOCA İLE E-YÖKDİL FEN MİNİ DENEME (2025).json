        "question": "There are many reasons why animal breeding is of paramount importance to those who use animals for their livelihood. Cats have been bred largely for aesthetic beauty; many people are willing to pay a great deal of money for a Siamese or Persian cat, even though the affection felt for a pet has little to do with physical appearance. For instance, most dog breeds are the result of a deliberate attempt to isolate traits that would produce better hunting and herding dogs, although some, like toy poodles, were bred for traits that would make them desirable pets. Horses have also been extensively bred for certain useful qualities; some for size and strength, some for speed.",
        "options": [
            "A) There is accumulating evidence that humans tend to be attracted to pets that exhibit similar physical traits.",
            "B) Although maximum food production is always a major goal, modern animal breeders are also concerned about the ability of animals to survive in extreme environments.",
            "C) Thus, animals are generally all bred for feed efficiency, growth rate, and resistance to disease.",
            "D) But the most extensive animal breeding has occurred in those areas where animals have been used to serve specific practical purposes.",
            "E) And farm animals, particularly food animals, have been the subject of the most intensive breeding efforts."

        "question": "Until the final quarter of the 20th century, the relationship between gender and technical change was included in the simple equation of masculinity with machinery. The prevailing view was that men’s physical strength equipped them to adopt machinery more readily than women. After all, machinery tends to be introduced to reduce physical effort in the production process, thus making it ideal for female use.",
        "options": [
            "A) Although they were competent in various areas, women were regarded as peripheral to the core of the labour market.",
            "B) Therefore, industries that employed relatively lowcost and abundant female labour faced little incentive to invest in expensive labour-saving technologies.",
            "C) Thus, the ideology of women as homemakers paved the way for the introduction of industrial technologies into the home.",
            "D) However, such biological reasoning failed to account for the social shaping of technology by existing ideologies of gendered work.",

        "question": "If you find the quantum world confusing, you are not alone. A recent study shows that physicists disagree over the picture of reality that quantum mechanics describes, and that many of them do not even care. Quantum mechanics refers to the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles in terms of quanta. There is no consensus: 39 per cent support the conventional picture of quantum mechanics, while 25 per cent support alternatives and 36 per cent have no preference at all. In addition, many are not sure they understand what certain interpretations describe.",

She received the Nobel Prize in Physics for her work on radioactivity in collaboration with her husband, Pierre Curie, and A.H. Becquerel. Thus, the 1903 prize in physics was shared by all three individuals and was the first of Curie's Nobel Prizes. Five prizes were conferred in the areas of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, economic sciences, and peace.

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Applied to various materials across many industries, nanotechnology is the science of the very small. Originally, it dealt with the engineering of nanoparticles to build mechanisms on an atomic level, but this has become only one definition, now referred to as MNT, or molecular nanotechnology. The meaning of nanotechnology has evolved to now include all scientific endeavours below 'micro technology', thereby encompassing any products and materials dealing with nanoscale operations. Due to the possibilities of nanotechnology in so many fields, the science has received increased attention from both businesses and masses in recent years. 'Nano' refers to the infinitesimal nanometre, one billionth of a metre; at this level, the components of molecules, atoms, and their parts are large enough to be physically manipulated, arranged, and built into layers. At the technical level, nanotechnology is interested in using these molecular construction abilities to create machines and computers at this nanoscale. In theory, these tiny systems will be capable of incredible speed and atomic precision performance. On a more universal and practical level, nanotechnology can arrange molecules to help create every day, life-size products with new qualities such as weather resistance, conductivity, and enhanced efficiency.

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- Svante August Arrhenius was a Swedish chemist and one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read, despite his parents' wishes, and by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy. This amazing scientist was the first person to predict what the future atmosphere might look like in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. He spent many of his days (and likely nights) at the end of the 19th century calculating how the carbon released by burning coal (the major source of fuel at the time) might actually change the atmospheric carbon balance. In the end, he calculated that humanity could double the concentration of atmospheric carbon - in 3,000 years. The fact that Earth is now closing in on doubling that concentration just over 100 years after Arrhenius made his calculations has nothing to do with this great visionary's grasp of chemistry or math - it has everything to do with the fact that he had to base estimates on what he knew. The internal combustion engine was only a speculative invention, with none in use. No cars were on the road, and Arrhenius certainly had no idea about traffic jams, drive-through windows, or airplanes.
