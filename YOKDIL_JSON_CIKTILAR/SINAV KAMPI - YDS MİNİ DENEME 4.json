When you have a cold, things get worse slowly, but the flu hits you like a high-speed train.",

            "A) Thanks for keeping me on track, but I wish I could go on holiday instead of going to summer school.",

            "A) Mood-enhancing endorphins are released only when people laugh heartily and thus they can tolerate pain better.",
            "B) People can tolerate more pain if their mood is enhanced by endorphins, which cause hearty laughter.",
            "C) If people want to enhance their mood, they should laugh heartily and tolerate pain better, which helps them release endorphins.",
            "D) To be able to laugh heartily by releasing endorphins that enhance their mood, people have to tolerate pain better.",

        "question": "As elephants walk through the forest or savanna, they leave big footprints behind them. These marks then fill with water, creating microhabitats for other forms of life. Researchers at Germany's University of Koblenz-Landau analysed the contents of 30 footprints in Uganda. They found at least 61 different microinvertebrate species, including mites. ---- Nevertheless, the study adds to a body of research suggesting that elephants play vital roles in their ecosystems.",

            "A) Researchers also think that this study serves as one more reminder of what we could lose if the illegal hunting crisis in Africa continues.",
            "B) Because elephants weigh upward of 6,000 kilograms, they make quite an impression with their giant footprints.",
            "C) Thanks to this study, researchers have proven without doubt that elephant footprints teem with life.",
            "D) This work is in its early stage and more needs to be done to understand how heavily the tiny species rely on these footprint worlds.",

        "question": "Cities are dense with impermeable sidewalks and streets, so the concrete jungle does not exactly absorb excess water during storms. The result: destructive flash floods. To help, a Danish architectural firm has developed a tile-based modular paving system that collects and distributes rainwater. ---- The system captures water from roofs, streets, and parking lots and delivers it to nearby permeable landscapes - such as garden boxes or park spaces - where it can be absorbed. The firm has already given a few Copenhagen sidewalks a face-lift this year to test out the tiles. But even before that experiment is finished, Toronto and several other cities have put in requests for the rain-draining material.",

            "A) Since permeable pavements come in different forms, urban planners in other countries prefer to use a type of porous asphalt to absorb storm run-off.",

            "C) These tiles resemble a normal paved surface but have small holes in them that funnel storm run-off into horizontally connected channels.",
            "D) Roads, sidewalks, and terraces connect people but are often also impermeable to rain or flood waters.",

(III) Flutes were among the earliest instruments to be found in all parts of the world. (IV) The first instrument was the one every person is born with - the body.

(IV) Stars, nebulae, or galaxies in the same constellation may or may not have anything in common.
