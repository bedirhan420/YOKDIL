Houseplants can pose a threat to your cat also. It is crucial that you know what plants are in your home and whether they are toxic to cats. Cats use plants to aid in digestion and will chew whatever plants are in your home. Providing cat grass can help with this, but it is best not to risk them ingesting a toxic plant. Lastly, make sure that you do not have random items lying around that may look like a fun toy. Elastics, pennies, nails and more may seem like a play thing to your cat, but can cause major health problems if ingested.
