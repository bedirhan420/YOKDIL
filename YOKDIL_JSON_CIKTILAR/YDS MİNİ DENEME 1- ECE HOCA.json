During this period, the pyramids were built and Egyptian society worshipped their mighty kings, or pharaohs, as 'gods on Earth'. Old Kingdom society was tightly controlled by the powerful pharaoh. Central to life, politics, and religion, which were all closely combined, was the idea that the pharaoh was a semi-divine figure who acted as mediator between the gods and his people. The pharaoh not only oversaw elaborate religious rituals but also headed a vast, highly organized political and administrative bureaucracy. Pharaohs were believed to be earthly representations of the gods and were the upholders of a justice system that aimed to reflect the cosmic order. A pharaoh was also the figure who worked with the gods to ensure that the Nile brought silt-rich annual floods each year, maintaining the Nile valley fertile enough to support the country. Though Egyptians did seem to realize he was a flesh-and-blood human, they stood in awe of the sacred power of the pharaoh. --- QUESTION --- What can be inferred from the passage about Egypt's Old Kingdom?

        "question": "--- PASSAGE --- In Indonesia, the rainforests are being destroyed due to the expansion of the palm oil industry. Today, palm oil is grown on an ever more huge scale, providing global commodity markets with vast quantities of cheap vegetable fat. Across the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo, palm oil plantations have so damaged the rainforest that experts expect the extinction of the orang-utan in the wild by about 2020, if nothing is done. More than 90 percent of the orang-utan’s original habitat is gone, and the remainder is under serious pressure, with the palm oil industry being backed by the Indonesian government even in protected areas where the last orang-utans live, for example, in southwest Borneo. The forests on these islands are also the home of countless other unique and rare species. Logging operations and plantation activities can increase the risk of serious fires, especially when coupled with unusually dry conditions. A very large fire may lead to further forest loss and increase pressure on neighbouring virgin forests by improving access to formerly remote areas. They also cause major public health problems across Indonesia and Malaysia, as the haze of smoke drifts across urbanized areas. --- QUESTION --- According to the passage, low costs of palm oil production has increased the size of the industry, but risking the rainforests.",
