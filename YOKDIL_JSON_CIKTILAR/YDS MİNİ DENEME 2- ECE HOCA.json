Thousands of sinkholes have formed in the receding sea’s wake, curtailing tourism and development along the border because no one can predict where the next gaping hole will suddenly open, potentially swallowing buildings, roads or people. Concerned over losing a valuable natural and cultural resource, officials from Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authorities have proposed an enormous conveyor system that would steadily refill the Dead Sea with water from the Red Sea to the south. Scientists are testing how the mixing of the waters might affect the lake’s chemistry and biology. --- QUESTION --- It is stated in the passage that ----.",

The Coastal Southern dialect centres on the Atlantic port cities of the states of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia, formed in a time of plantation and ranch agriculture.
